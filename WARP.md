# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React + TypeScript application for generating professional email signatures for Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte (UCN). The application allows users to input their contact information and generates HTML email signatures that can be copied and pasted into Gmail.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Development Workflow
- Development server runs on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default)
- Hot reload is enabled for rapid development
- TypeScript compilation happens on-the-fly during development

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure
- **Single Page Application**: Built with React and centered around a signature generation workflow
- **State Management**: Uses a custom hook (`useSignatureGenerator`) for centralized state management
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between form input, preview, and utility components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent, utility-first styling

### Key Components & Responsibilities
- `App.tsx`: Main orchestrator, handles layout and component composition
- `useSignatureGenerator.ts`: Core business logic hook managing signature data, clipboard operations, and HTML generation
- `SignatureForm.tsx`: Form interface for user input with validation
- `SignaturePreview.tsx`: Real-time preview of the generated signature
- `CopyButton.tsx`: Handles clipboard operations with fallback mechanisms
- `Header.tsx`: Application header and branding

### Data Flow
1. User inputs data through `SignatureForm`
2. State is managed in `useSignatureGenerator` hook
3. `SignaturePreview` shows real-time preview
4. `CopyButton` generates HTML and copies to clipboard
5. HTML includes table-based layout for email client compatibility

## Technical Stack Details

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent UI elements

### Email Signature Generation
- **HTML Table Layout**: Uses table-based structure for maximum email client compatibility
- **Inline Styles**: All styles are inlined to ensure proper rendering across email clients
- **Clipboard API**: Modern clipboard API with fallback for copying HTML content
- **Logo Integration**: References `/disc.svg` (UCN logo) with absolute positioning

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with Clipboard API support
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### Component Patterns
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Props are explicitly typed with interfaces
- Custom hooks for business logic separation
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

### State Management Pattern
- Single source of truth in `useSignatureGenerator`
- Immutable state updates using spread operators
- Centralized clipboard operations with error handling
- Form validation logic integrated into state management

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind utility classes for rapid development
- Consistent color scheme using UCN brand colors (#6B88A3, #B65A2C, #2C3E50)
- Responsive grid layout for form and preview sections
- Professional, accessibility-friendly design patterns

### HTML Generation Strategy
- Template literal for HTML signature generation
- Conditional rendering based on filled fields
- Email-safe HTML structure (tables, inline styles)
- UCN branding and contact information templating

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Extract business logic into custom hooks
- Maintain TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Styling Guidelines
- Follow Tailwind utility-first approach
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing patterns
- Use semantic color classes from the established palette
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

### Email Signature Constraints
- HTML must be email-client compatible (primarily table-based layout)
- All styles must be inline for maximum compatibility
- Logo path must be absolute and accessible from email clients
- Structure must maintain visual consistency across different email platforms

## Bolt Integration Notes

This project was initially scaffolded with Bolt.new and includes:
- `.bolt/` directory with configuration and prompt settings
- Optimized for beautiful, production-ready designs
- JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes as default
- Lucide React for icons (avoid installing additional icon packages)
- Focus on clean, professional UI suitable for institutional use
